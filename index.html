            <h4><a href="https://youtu.be/V_x8XcACV8w?si=0vdhaJtN3gmfyGz1"> Breda Guardian: Teacher VS Student</a></h4> 
            <p>This is the first project I worked on during my education at BUas. This was also the first time I ever did audio (which can be heard through the quality at certain points), however I did learned alot from this experience. During this project I had the pleasure to work with brilliant and creative individuals, who have helped me through out this whole project.</p>

            <p>After 3 weeks at Bournemouth University and 9 weeks of hard work, my team and I produced our Live TV Show "Beach Heroes"<br>
            This production has taught me more than I could have ever imagined and filling the role of VT Operator was a wonderful new learning experience. </p>

				<p> In my second year of my Bachelor, I had the privilege to produce a personal short-documentary.<br> Together with my amazing team, we produced <br>"Farming With Care: More Than a Business". <br>
                This documentary is about a Care Farm in the Netherlands, owned by my family members. The Care Farm is a small-scale farm where people with an intellectual and/or physical disability and/or psychiatric disorder are offered appropriate and valuable daytime activities.</p>
				<p> This was my first experience with producing, and it was a fantastic learning experience.</p>

				<p>During this project, I had the role of director. This was quit an experience as this project was an aftermovie. The limited controle that I had during production was challenging, hiowever in the end, the team was content with the end results. And most importantly, so was the client.</p>
