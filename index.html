            <p>This is the first project I worked on during my education at BUas. This was also the first time I ever did audio (which can be heard through the quality at certain points), however I did learned alot from this experience. During this project I had the pleasure to work with brilliant and creative individuals, who have helped me through out this whole project.</p>

            <p>After 3 weeks at Bournemouth University and 9 weeks of hard work, my team and I produced our Live TV Show "Beach Heroes"<br>
            This production has taught me more than I could have ever imagined and filling the role of VT Operator was a wonderful new learning experience. </p>

				<p>We produced <u>"Farming With Care: More Than a Business"</u>. This was my first experience as a producer, and it was a fantastic learning experience.
                This documentary is about a Care Farm in the Netherlands, owned by my family members, where people with an intellectual and/or physical disability and/or psychiatric disorder are offered appropriate and valuable daytime activities.</p>

				<p>During this project, I had the role of director. This was quit an experience as this project was an aftermovie. The limited controle that I had during production was challenging, hiowever in the end, the team was content with the end results. And most importantly, so was the client.</p>

				<p>Together with our amazing AV team, 4 product videos for Bourgini were created. My role in this process was the concepts making and storyboarding of the videos. Unfortunately due to an other project, which required traveling outside the country, I was unable to film the videos myself. However I am very proud of my team, and the end results. All videos can now be viewed on <a href="https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/bourgini-chef-s-dinnerparty-gourmet-bakplaat-4-tot-5-pers/9300000004070998/?bltgh=lIPB4sdWTGScGtV3vrtAMA.2_13.14.ProductImage">Bol.com</a>.The videos were created for each product:<a href="https://youtu.be/mjOCx6ZVjgM">Chef Dinner Set</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/qX5PLBEEyeI">Contact Grill</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/4189VX9hYfk">Multiplate</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/BoD1XY_Z35o">Raclette</a>.</p>
